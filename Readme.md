# Typescript Lesson 2 - Exploring Data Types

In this lesson you will look at some TypeScript code to help you explore the different *types* of data you can use in a program.

## Getting Set Up
- [ ] Clone this folder to your computer (in the ibcs folder!) using Github Desktop - you may need to use `File -> Clone Repository -> GitHub.com` to find it. 
- [ ] Open the assignment in VS Code.
- [ ] Open the `dataTypes.ts` file.

## Completing the Assignment
- [ ] The complete instructions for this assignment are in the `dataTypes.ts` file. Read carefully, answer all questions, and complete all tasks. Only in the last step will it have you compile your code and test. Once you've tested, you can go back and make any changes you need.

## Handing in - A reminder of how!

### Option 1: Committing and Pushing in VS Code
- [ ] Click the Git button on the left side. It looks like this: ![Git button](media/img008_git_button.png)
- [ ] Click the `+` that appears when you hover over the `+` sidebar to stage your change.
- [ ] Type 'Ready to hand in - *your name*` in the `Message` box, then click the checkbox. This **commits** the file.
- [ ] Finally, click the little three-dot menu, and choose 'Push'. This will put the assignment on the web so I can actually see it. You may need to enter your username and password on github (look for a little box at the top prompting for that!)

### Option 2: Committing and Pushing in Github Desktop

- [ ] Open GitHub Desktop again. It should open to the same folder that was open earlier.
- [ ] On the left, you should see `1 Changed File` - `first_script_ever.ts`. On the right, you'll see all the changes you made to that file.
- [ ] The file should already have a check mark next to it; that means it is already *staged* and ready to commit. Click the small box next to the icon and write a message like "Ready to hand in - *your name*", then click the `Commit to `**`master`** button at the bottom.
- [ ] It has now been saved (permanently and retrievably!) *to your computer*, but to hand it in you need to put it online. At the top, click the button that says `Push origin`
